#   - Other Scholarships:
#     - Applicants cannot be currently receiving any other scholarship from an entity in the Oil and Gas industry, whether national or international. 
#   - Academic Qualification:
#     - For undergraduate courses, applicants usually need five distinctions (As and Bs) in relevant subjects in their WAEC/WASSCE (May/June) exams, including English and Mathematics.

# Task3: Online Store Cart Calculation**
# - Create a list of items (e.g., "Book", "Pen", "Bag") and another list of prices (e.g., 500, 100, 2000).
# - Start with an empty cart total (cart_total = 0).
# - Use assignment operators (+=) to add the price of some items into cart_total.
# - Print the list of items and the total price using an f-string like this:
# ```
# Items: ['Book', 'Pen', 'Bag']
# Total Price: â‚¦600

# task4: Student Record**
# - Create an empty dictionary called student.
# - Ask the user to input their name and age, then store them in the dictionary.
# - Add a list of scores (e.g., [70, 85, 90]) to the dictionary.
# - Use a comparison operator to check if the student has passed (average score >= 50). Save the result (True/False) in the dictionary under the key "passed".
# - Use a logical operator to check if the student is a teenager (age between 13 and 19). Save the result as "teenager".
# - Print out the complete record in this format:
# ```
# Student Record:
# Name: John
# Age: 16
# Scores: [70, 85, 90]
# Passed: True
# Teenager: True

# **Task5: Store Inventory Update**
# - Create a dictionary called store with items and their available quantities. Example:
# store = {"Book": 10, "Pen": 20, "Bag": 5}
# - Ask the user to input the item they want to buy (e.g., "Pen").
# - Ask the user to input the quantity they want to purchase.
# - Use the assignment operator -= to update (reduce) the item quantity in the dictionary.
# - Print the updated dictionary in this format:
# Before purchase: {'Book': 10, 'Pen': 20, 'Bag': 5}
# After purchase: {'Book': 10, 'Pen': 18, 'Bag': 5}
